<h2>Progressive Enhancement Blog Post</h2>
<p>Progressive Enhancement, in my opinion, is building first, enhancements later. Progressive Enhancement is the essential CONTENT of a website used to make consumers gain infromation and have a simple mechanic of navigation. Progressive Enhancement helps coders design a website thats the best version of itself, also includs Web Accessibility into the mix. I believe Progressive Enhancement is good for a web developer because even though this can make a website seem simple to navigate, it: "progresses the user experience up to a more-compelling, fully-featured experience for users of newer browsers and devices with richer capabilities."(<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">Mozilla</a>) Progressive Enhancement, can be shortened to PE, which gives you an example of how it works. In PE, you have to do multiple warm-ups before getting to the fun part of coding, the end. In the article, there is content, presentation, and the client-slide scripting. The warmups will be considered the content and presentation, and the ending will be considered the client-scripting. "The PE strategy focuses on a strong foundation for your project. This strong foundation helps you in your vision for your product for a long term plan."

<h3>Perfume Web Site Revision and Reflection</h3>
<p>
  This time around, I focused too much on the content of the website instead of the actual workings of the website. I also suffered from trying to add extra details before building out my website, even though I hadd my Figma replication. Some information that was given to me as feedback was to make sure I have a clear color scheme for each page and a clear css so I don't have to go into my website and individually change the css for each page. I wish I stuck with simplicity because I overshot myself, and had to finish it all yesterday(18th) and today(19th) to get it working properly. Going into the latest of the night to work on it, and not even getting sleep. I had doctors appointments I couldn't miss (wisdom teeth extraction yesterday) and other crucial things that I had to do. I wish I had more time to work on it, but I'm glad I got it done. I'm proud of my work, but I know I could've done better. I'm glad I got to work on this project, and I hope to work on more projects like this, alone, and have better time management skills and deadlines, because when working with a client, they have a set deadline that needs to be met. However, I am glad I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and got it done. I just need to rmemeber there is grading on the actual workings of the website, NOT the CONTENT.

  function showSlides() {
    let slides = document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides");
    for (let i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {
      slides[i].style.display = "none";  
    }
    slideIndex++;
    if (slideIndex > slides.length) {slideIndex = 1}    
    slides[slideIndex-1].style.display = "block";  
    setTimeout(showSlides, 2000); // Change image every 2 seconds
  }
